<p>Imagine a world where dating is mostly done online, selecting potential mates with the <br>
swipe of a finger instead of a lengthy courtship process.  A poke on facebook instead of an <br>
awkward set-up with someone's cousin.  Well, check your watch, brother, cause we are already living</br>
there.</p>

<p>In a world where dating is becoming more casual and interactions are fleeting, our app gives users<br>
a place to keep the details of their dating life in order.  Little Black Book is a <br>
dating management app to handle your contacts from online dating apps, with post-date reflection and review, <br>
as well as an in-date reminders for talking points and subtle nudges in the right direction. <br></p>
