<p>Imagine a world where dating is mostly done online, selecting potential mates with the swipe of a finger instead of a lengthy courtship process.  A poke on facebook instead of an awkward set-up with someone's cousin.  Well, check your map, brother, cause we are already living there.</p>

<p>In a world where dating is becoming more casual and interactions are fleeting, our app gives users a place to keep the details of their dating life in order.  Little Black Book is a dating management app to handle your contacts from online dating apps, with post-date reflection and review, as well as an in-date reminders for talking points and subtle nudges in the right direction.</p>

<p>Our group's workflow fluctuated between rotating pair programming, and individual nose-to-the-grindstone hacking, as dictated by the days stand-up each morning.  All team members contributed fairly and played to their strengths, as well as helping each other out with any problems</p>
